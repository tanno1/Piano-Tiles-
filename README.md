# Piano-Tiles-
Ongoing project to create an AI to automatically beat Piano Tiles (http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/)

I have designed this to run on my 15 inch macbook pro with the piano tiles window on the left half of my screen and scrolled fully up to the top. 
This program uses a few pyautogui commands and is relatively simple. Ideally, you can run the program, then the program will take over and click the first tile and then continusously scan each of the four coordinates and find when one of the pixels scanned has a RGB value correspondonging to black, in which it will then click. The game will be able to be ended anytime by clicking "Q" on the keyboard. 

My current issue is that mac does not like when I use commands to take over the keyboard so I am going to transfer this onto windows and then try to run it tonight
